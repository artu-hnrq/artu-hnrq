# Learnlog

Since I'm constantly looking up to learn, I use to fell it would be nice to have a history of the readings, videos, practices, ensights or any other content I passed through during my study times. I've tried other tools, but them I realized that a changelog-kind file could do the work without any burocracy; Here is it!

This file format is inspired on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), however it adheres to [Sentimental Versioning](http://sentimentalversioning.org/) instead of [Semantic](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) one.
